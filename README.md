A MATLAB implementation of R-RANSAC with the SPRT test (WALDSAC)
based on Matas and Chum's 2008 paper [link](https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~matas/papers/chum-waldsac-iccv05.pdf).

The SPRT test was pioneered by Wald in 1945, in his seminal [Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-mathematical-statistics/volume-16/issue-2/Sequential-Tests-of-Statistical-Hypotheses/10.1214/aoms/1177731118.full) paper, very readworthy due to very clear and intuitive presentation.
